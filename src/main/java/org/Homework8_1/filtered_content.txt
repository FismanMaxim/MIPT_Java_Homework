The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there’s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th’oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th’unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovere’d country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
