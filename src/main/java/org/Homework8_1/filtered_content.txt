The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there’s the respect
Th’oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
The undiscovere’d country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!
